TODO: Problem-12: There are 40 chairs in your class. A few days ago, the legs of 2 chairs broke. Now assign a variable called chairsCount and update the number of chairs. After a few days, a senior brother from your class came, took 6 chairs, and left. Again, you update the value of chairsCount and show the final output in the console.
 */
//Solution: 

let chairsCount = 40;
chairsCount -= 2;
console.log(chairsCount);
// Output: 38
chairsCount -= 6;
console.log(chairsCount);
// Output: 32
