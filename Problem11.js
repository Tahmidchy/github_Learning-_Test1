TODO: Problem-11: You bought a phone for 25,000, and a month later you sold it for 12,000. Now you declare a variable called phonePrice and first assign a value of 25,000 to that variable, then update that value to 12,000, and finally, check the console to see which value is displayed as the output.
 */

//Solution: 

let phonePrice = 25000;
phonePrice -= 12000;
console.log(phonePrice); // Output: 12000
